# PixabayAPI

A small iOS application in Swift that shows a gallery of images from a search input using the https://pixabay.com API. 

## How to run the app

There are no third party dependencies, just launch the app in Xcode. The app supports iPhones and both landscape and portrait mode, although landscape mode is not really tested. There is no iPad support yet, however you should still be able to run it on an iPad in simulator mode.

## My main goals with the project

I wanted to have a simple app with a few view controllers where I can play around with networking, different architectural patterns, unit testing and all kind of small technical stuff to learn new things while still working on something "real", instead of checking some made up problems with random tutorials.
